# Risk Game Clone

This will hopefully be a clone of the board game Risk. We'll see how it goes though.

## Install Instructions
This project uses these go modules.
- `github.com/gin-contrib/static`
- `github.com/gin-gonic/gin`

`go get` these packages, then run `go run .` to run the server.

## TODO
- each backend api route has lots of similar code, make it more generic
